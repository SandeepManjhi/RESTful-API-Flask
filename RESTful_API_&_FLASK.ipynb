        "Q.1 What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "  - A RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It's based on the idea of resources, which are identified by URIs, and can be manipulated using a fixed set of operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Key Characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Resource-based: Everything in REST is a resource (e.g., users, products, orders).\n",
        "    2. Client-server architecture: The client and server are separate, with the client making requests to the server.\n",
        "    3. Stateless: Each request contains all the information necessary to complete the request.\n",
        "    4. Cacheable: Responses can be cached to reduce the number of requests.\n",
        "    5. Uniform interface: A standard interface is used for all interactions (e.g., HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
        "\n",
        "    Common HTTP Verbs:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. GET: Retrieve a resource\n",
        "    2. POST: Create a new resource\n",
        "    3. PUT: Update an existing resource\n",

        "  app.run()\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6 What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "  - HTTP methods are used in RESTful APIs to define the actions performed on resources. Here are the most common HTTP methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. GET\n",
        "- Purpose: Retrieve a resource\n",
        "- Example: Get a list of users or a specific user's details\n",
        "- Idempotent: Yes (multiple GET requests have the same effect as a single GET request)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. POST\n",
        "- Purpose: Create a new resource\n",
        "- Example: Create a new user or add a new product\n",
        "- Idempotent: No (multiple POST requests can create multiple resources)\n",

        "- Purpose: Partially update an existing resource\n",
        "- Example: Update a specific field of a user's details\n",
        "- Idempotent: No (multiple PATCH requests can have different effects)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7 What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "  - The @app.route() decorator in Flask is used to associate a function with a specific URL. It tells Flask to call the decorated function when the specified URL is accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Key Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. URL mapping: Maps a URL to a specific function in the application.\n",
        "    2. HTTP method handling: Allows specification of HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for the route.\n",
        "    3. Route parameters: Supports passing parameters from the URL to the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "    How it Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. The @app.route() decorator is applied to the hello_world function.\n",
        "    2. When the /hello URL is accessed with a GET request, Flask calls the hello_world function.\n",
        "    3. The function returns the response, which is sent back to the client.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Benefits:\n",

        "    1. Easy URL mapping: Simplifies the process of mapping URLs to application functions.\n",
        "    2. Flexible routing: Supports various HTTP methods and route parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.8 What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "  - The main difference between GET and POST HTTP methods is the way they send data to the server and the purpose they serve.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ##### GET Method\n",
        "    1. Purpose: Retrieve data from the server.\n",
        "    2. Data transmission: Data is sent in the URL as query parameters.\n",
        "    3. Data visibility: Data is visible in the URL.\n",
        "    4. Data length: Limited data length (usually around 2000 characters).\n",
        "    5. Caching: Responses can be cached by the browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ##### POST Method\n",
        "    1. Purpose: Send data to the server to create or update a resource.\n",
        "    2. Data transmission: Data is sent in the request body.\n",
        "    3. Data visibility: Data is not visible in the URL.\n",
        "    4. Data length: No limit on data length.\n",
        "    5. Caching: Responses are not cached by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "    When to Use:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. GET: Use for retrieving data, such as fetching a list of users or a specific user's details.\n",
        "    2. POST: Use for creating or updating data, such as creating a new user or updating an existing user's details.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - GET /users: Retrieve a list of users.\n",
        "    - POST /users: Create a new user.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Security Considerations:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Sensitive data: Avoid sending sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers) using GET requests, as the data is visible in the URL.\n",
        "    2. Data tampering: Use POST requests when sending sensitive data or when the data needs to be protected from tampering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9 How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "  - Error handling in a Flask API primarily involves using Flask's built-in error handling mechanisms and, for more advanced scenarios, custom exception classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Using Flask's errorhandler decorator:\n",
        "This is the most common and recommended way to handle specific HTTP errors or custom exceptions. You define a function that will be executed when a particular error or exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Raising HTTPException or custom exceptions:\n",
        "You can explicitly raise HTTPException subclasses (like NotFound, BadRequest, etc.) or your own custom exceptions within your route functions. Flask's error handling will then catch these and direct them to the appropriate errorhandler.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Global Error Handling (Catch-all):\n",
        "You can register a handler for the base Exception class to catch any unhandled exceptions, providing a generic error response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.10 How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "  - Here's Step-by-step process to connect Flask to a SQL database:\n",
